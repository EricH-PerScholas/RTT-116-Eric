        // !!!!!! best practicce is to always use let when defining variables and only
        // use var when you know you need it globally avilable for the document.   Have to 
        // have a reason why you think it should be global.

        // var becomes a global variable accesable by any function
        // in the document 
        /* can also do this java style ... this is dangerous i have seen pages not work
          and be very hard to diagnose why due to this commenting especially when 
          there are code chunks within it. */
        var a = 10;
        var b = "String";
        var c = true;
        let x = 10;
        
        function abc() {
            // let scopes this variable to the containing {}
            let x = 15;
            var y = 20;
            console.log(y);
        }

        console.log(x);

        // x is not available here because it is confied inside the function
        // y IS available here because it was defined as a var which is global scope to the document

        abc();

        // this is similar to System.out.println("") and writes to the console on the browser inspect
        console.log("hello world");


        // == is comparing the value
        let e1 = 3 == 3; // isEqual is true
        let e2 = 3 == "3"; // isEqual is true
        let e3 = "3" == "3"; // isEqual is true

        // === compares the value and the type
        let e4 = "3" === 3; // e4 is false because === compares the type
        let e5 = 3 === 3; // this is true because same type and same value

        // common gotacha in javascript
        // when using + if one of your variables is a string then it will
        // do string concatination rather than aritmatic
        let o = "8";
        console.log(o + 8);
        console.log("8" + 8);
        console.log(8 + "8");
